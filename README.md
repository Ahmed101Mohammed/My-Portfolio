# My-Portfolio
It is a portfolio web app, that I built to present my skills in pure ***HTML***, ***CSS***, and ***JS***, and at the same time I use it as a real personal portfolio that represents my information.

## App description:
### App sections:
- Header: To help you to move in portfolio sections, and also provide the ability to hire me.
- Home: I represent myself in this section with photos of me.
- Skills: From the name of the section you can expect that I represent my skills here.
- Portfolio: In this section, I represent my projects in cards, with information for each project.
- Footer: For copyright sign, the author, and the last date of modifying this portfolio.
### App features:
The application gives you 3 main features:
- Static data to know more about me.
- Flexibility to filter the projects I do according to my skills.
- Hire Me button that helps you to go to my Upwork account to hire me.
### Application technologies:
For this app, I used these technologies:
- HTML5: To design the structure of the app.
- CSS3: To add styling to the design.
- JS: To make the site more dynamic.
### Main challenge I face in this project:
The main challenge that I faced in this project was: how to handle scroll animation without using libraries, and this led me to learn more about the APIs of both the Documentation object and the window object.
